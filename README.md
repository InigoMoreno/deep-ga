# deep-ga
Global Alignment using Deep Learning

For the moment this is just a python package with some helper functions

# Installation
This will try to install tensorflow, for this to work, you need python 3.6-3.8 (see [https://www.tensorflow.org/install](https://www.tensorflow.org/install))
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/InigoMoreno/deep_ga
```

# Usage
The notebooks folder contains Jupyter notebooks that are able to run the tests. The most important are Train.ipynb which runs a single Talos experiment on the HiRISE dataset, and TrainTenerife.ipynb which does the same for the Tenerife dataset. However, you will not be able to run the latter without having the files already downloaded.
